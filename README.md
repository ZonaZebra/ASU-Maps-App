# My Maps App

This web application allows users to view maps, search for locations, and calculate the shortest route between two points. It integrates various mapping technologies to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Map Display

The application uses the Leaflet mapping library to display OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Leaflet provides a responsive and customizable map display, allowing users to zoom in and out, pan the map, and view additional information like points of interest and street names.

## Geocoding

To enable location search, the application integrates a geocoding service. Currently, the application uses Nominatim as its geocoding service. Users can search for locations and view the corresponding geographic coordinates.

## Routing

The application integrates the OpenRouteService routing engine to calculate the shortest path between two points. Users can specify their start and end locations, and the application will provide a route with distance and estimated time of arrival.

## Traffic Data

The application does not currently integrate traffic data but can be extended in the future to support real-time traffic data.

## User Interface

The application's user interface is built using React. It provides an intuitive and responsive interface that allows users to interact with the map and search for locations. The interface also displays the calculated route with distance and estimated time of arrival.

## Hosting and Infrastructure

The application is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is used to host the application, and Simple Storage Service (S3) is used to store the data. The Relational Database Service (RDS) is used to store and manage the application's data. The application's performance is optimized by implementing caching, load balancing, and other techniques.

## Future Development

The application can be extended in the future to support real-time traffic data and other features such as turn-by-turn directions, alternative routes, and more. The user interface can also be further optimized and refined to provide a better user experience.
